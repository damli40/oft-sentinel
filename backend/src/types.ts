/**
 * Will this corridor ACCEPT A SEND right now?
 *
 * ⚠️ SENDABLE IS NOT DELIVERABLE. This is the single most important thing to know about
 * this type, and getting it wrong is not hypothetical — it is why the receive-side dead
 * pathway was first mis-scored as a harmless LOW advisory.
 *
 * `quoteSend()` is priced entirely on the SOURCE chain, against the send library and the
 * send ULN. It knows nothing whatsoever about the destination's receive config. So a
 * successful quote proves only that the endpoint will price and accept a message — never
 * that anything arrives.
 *
 * A corridor can therefore be SENDABLE and still be permanently undeliverable:
 *   - send confirmations < the destination's required confirmations
 *   - the destination requires a DVN the sender does not pay
 *   - the destination's required DVN set is an LZ Dead DVN placeholder
 * In every one of those, tokens leave the source and never arrive. That is STRICTLY WORSE
 * than an unsendable route — an unsendable route at least refuses the money. Deliverability
 * is a separate axis, decided by the receive-side rules, and it must stay that way.
 *
 * What this type IS good for: teams pre-wire destination chains long before opening them,
 * so a corridor can carry a fully-formed config no message has ever crossed. A security
 * claim about money that cannot even be sent is not a security claim (see capBySendability),
 * and sendability is what separates a dormant, harmless misconfiguration from a live trap.
 *
 *  - SENDABLE   — quoteSend() returned a fee. The corridor accepts and prices a message.
 *                 Says NOTHING about whether it will be delivered.
 *  - UNSENDABLE — quoteSend() reverted. Nothing can enter this corridor at all.
 *  - UNKNOWN    — the probe itself failed (RPC error, no peer to quote against). NOT a
 *                 verdict. Never caps severity: an infra hiccup must not be able to
 *                 suppress a real CRITICAL.
