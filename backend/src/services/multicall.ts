 * downstream as "nothing to report" and suppress findings. Failing at import
 * is the safe direction: a process that will not start cannot mis-report.
 *
 * Blank is the one exception, and it is a different kind of input. A bare
 * `MULTICALL_CHUNK_SIZE=` in a .env file, or an env var cleared to "" in the
 * Railway dashboard, carries no value and no typo — it is an empty field, not a
 * wrong one. This runs as a production monitor, so refusing to boot on an empty
 * field is the worse outcome: the default is known-good and documented, and a
 * running monitor on defaults beats a dead one. Whitespace-only is treated the
 * same, since a value of " " survives copy-paste and shell quoting unnoticed.
 *
 * A genuinely malformed value ("abc", "0", "-1", "2.5") still throws. Those say
 * someone meant something specific and got it wrong, and guessing past a typo is
 * how a 5000-call chunk size or a concurrency of 0 reaches production unnoticed.
