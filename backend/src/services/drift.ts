// placeholder are classified as unconfigured/blocked (LOW advisory), not scored as a
// live 1-of-1 / default-library CRITICAL — an un-wired placeholder is not a security
// posture the team chose (weETH Base→Zircuit false positive). A real single DVN still
// fires CRITICAL. Attestations made under earlier versions stay valid as recorded.
// Bumped 1.3.0 → 2.0.0 (MAJOR): every Finding now carries an `evidence` tag, which
// changes the Finding schema and therefore the PDR shape and its verdictHash.
// Attestations made under 1.x hash under the old schema and stay valid as recorded;
// recomputation of a 1.x verdict must use the 1.x PDR as stored.
//
// The evidence law replaces three hand-written severity downgrades (Fireblocks MPC,
// non-Safe proxy owner, and the general "we can't see custody" problem) with one rule.
//
// Bumped 2.0.0 → 2.1.0 (MINOR): no schema change, but finding CONTENT changes, so the
// PDR hash of a re-assessed snapshot moves.
//   1. srcChainKey is derived from the snapshot's own chain instead of the hardcoded
//      "mantle". DVN names, ids and deprecation are per-chain — the same address is a
//      different operator on different chains — so every non-Mantle asset was resolving
//      its DVN names against Mantle's table.
//   2. Self-DVN is identified by a curated ticker → operator-id allowlist rather than a
//      name substring test (which credited ticker "O" with operating "LayerZero Labs"),
//      and is therefore `observed` rather than `inferred`.
//   3. A failed proxyAdmin.owner() read no longer interpolates the string "undefined"
//      into the finding detail.
//
// Bumped 2.1.0 → 3.0.0 (MAJOR): the PDR gains `dvnMetaHash` + `dvnMetaFetchedAt`, so the
// shape and the verdictHash both change. 2.x attestations hash under the old schema and
// stay valid as recorded; recomputing a 2.x verdict must use the 2.x PDR as stored.
//
// Why the PDR had to grow: assessSnapshot() was never a pure function of
// (config, declarations). It also reads the LZ DVN metadata table, and a DVN deprecated
// upstream flips a severity with no config change at all. Now that we deliberately serve a
// stale table rather than an empty one on an API outage, that third input is a real
// variable and the determinism invariant ("same config → same verdict") is only honest if
// the verdict names the table it was computed against.
//
// Dead-DVN detection is also now strictly per-chain. `deadAddresses` was a flat
// cross-chain address union, but 14 addresses are an LZ Dead DVN placeholder on one chain
// and a live DVN on another (0x28b6140e… is dead on flare and "LayerZero Labs" on mantle).
// A flat union classifies a genuine 1-of-1 on such a DVN as an unconfigured dead pathway
// and SUPPRESSES its CRITICAL — the exact Kelp shape this rule exists to preserve. That is
// a severity change, hence MAJOR: a route that scored LOW/Dead Pathway may now score
// CRITICAL, correctly.
//
// Bumped 3.0.0 → 4.0.0 (MAJOR): the PDR shape is unchanged, but severities move on real
// assets in both directions, which by the precedent above is a MAJOR change. Three fixes,
// all forced by taking a corridor the engine called "permanently blocked" and verifying it
// on-chain, where it turned out to be live, delivering, and healthy:
//
//   1. SECURITY IS SCORED ON THE RECEIVE SIDE. The DVN Count rule read `uln` — the SEND
//      config — but the sender only decides who gets PAID to verify. The receiver decides
//      who must ATTEST for a message to be accepted, and that quorum is the only thing an
//      attacker has to defeat. An OFT can pay three DVNs on the source chain and score
//      clean while accepting on one at the destination — so an OFT whose RECEIVE side is
//      1-of-1 would have scored PASS. That is a MISSED Kelp, the inverse of the false
//      positive that started this, and the more dangerous of the two. Sentinel now scores
//      the enforcement boundary.
//
//   2. DVN MISMATCH IS A DELIVERABILITY TEST, NOT A SECURITY TEST — and it is a SUBSET
//      test, not an equality test. Delivery needs the sender to pay for everything the
//      receiver requires; paying for MORE is legal and common (LZ's documented
//      "non-blocking mismatch"). The old rule demanded the two sets be equal and declared
//      every difference a permanent block. In practice the difference is usually the
//      receiver's OPTIONAL set, which the old comparison ignored entirely — so the two
//      sides were identical in identity space and nothing was ever blocked. A genuine
//      block (receiver requires a DVN the sender does not pay) still fires HIGH.
//
//   3. SENDABILITY BOUNDS EVERY CLAIM. Teams pre-wire destination chains months before
//      they open them, so a corridor can carry a full config no message has ever crossed.
//      A CRITICAL about money that cannot even be sent is noise. quoteSend() now gates
//      severity (see capBySendability). An UNSENDABLE corridor caps at MEDIUM and pops to
//      its true severity the day it opens; UNKNOWN never caps, so an RPC failure can never
//      suppress a real finding.
//
//      ⚠️ SENDABLE IS NOT DELIVERABLE. quoteSend is priced on the SOURCE chain and knows
//      nothing about the destination's receive config, so it proves only that a corridor
//      ACCEPTS a send. A corridor can be SENDABLE and permanently undeliverable — send
//      confirmations below the destination's requirement, a destination requiring a DVN
//      the sender never pays, a destination whose required DVN set is a dead placeholder.
//      In all three, tokens leave the source and never arrive. That is a FUNDS TRAP, and
//      it is strictly worse than an unsendable route, which at least declines the money.
//      Sendability therefore does two jobs: it caps claims on corridors nothing can enter,
//      and it is what distinguishes a harmless dormant misconfiguration from a live trap.
//
// The through-line, and the same lesson as the evidence law: the engine was asserting a
// risk it had not measured. It measured the send side and claimed the receive side; it
// measured a set difference and claimed a permanent block; it measured a config and
// claimed value was at risk without checking that value could move at all.

// succeeding, so a dangerous pre-wired corridor pops to its true severity the moment it
// opens, which is the moment it starts mattering.

// ── The delivery law ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE lesson of this project, and it took three false findings to learn it:

//     the engine kept measuring a CONFIG property and asserting a CONSEQUENCE.
//
// It saw a send/receive DVN set difference and said "permanently blocked" — the corridor
// was delivering. It saw a confirmation asymmetry and said "permanently blocked" — the
// corridor had delivered every message ever sent through it. It saw a dead receive-side
// DVN set and said "funds are stranded" — nobody had ever sent a message into it.
//
// The evidence law did not catch any of these, because it governs how confidently a rule
// may SPEAK, not whether the thing it speaks about was ever OBSERVED. A rule earned
// `observed` by observing the config, then spent it asserting the outcome.
//
// So delivery is now counted, never inferred. `outboundNonce` says what left;
// `inboundNonce` says what landed. No rule may claim a message does not get through
// without them — and the two laws compose: an unmeasured block claim is `inferred`, which
// the evidence law already caps at MEDIUM. A false CRITICAL becomes structurally
// impossible for this whole family of findings, rather than merely discouraged.

/**
 * THE DELIVERY LAW (corrected 2026-07-15; the first version of this function encoded
 * the opposite and shipped a downgrade):
 *
 *   Delivery evidence is HISTORICAL; config is CURRENT. Nonces can never SOFTEN a
 *   config-derived block claim. They can only ESCALATE it (funds observably stranded)
 *   or CONTRADICT it (messages crossing under the exact config that says they cannot —
 *   which means one of our reads is wrong: a sensor-integrity flag, not a downgrade).
 *
 * Why softening was wrong, empirically: a live corridor showed sent == delivered, which
 * the old law read as "the corridor works despite the config → MEDIUM". Every delivery
 * predated the config change by more than a year. Nothing had ever crossed under the
 * config we scored — and the first message sent after the change is BLOCKED on
 * LayerZero Scan to this day. `sent == delivered` was stale evidence, and the
 * downgrade it bought was a false MEDIUM on a real HIGH.
 *
 * So: severity comes from CONFIG + DOCS and is passed in by the rule; delivery supplies
 * EXPOSURE, spoken in the note. The finding's evidence is `observed` in every state —
 * what is observed is the misconfiguration itself, on-chain, against LZ's own docs.

    // either the sending OApp has increased the outbound block confirmations, or the
    // receiving OApp decreases the inbound block confirmation threshold." The FAQ and the
    // debugging-messages page both list this mismatch as a cause of the "Blocked" status:

    // History, because this rule has been wrong in BOTH directions:
    //   v1 said "permanently blocked" off two integers with no delivery measurement.

    //   the DVN-implementer guide (build-dvns step 4: the DVN waits per the RECEIVE
    //   config), which is not the page that governs OApp risk, and on delivery history
    //   that entirely predated the config change (every send landed over a year before
    //   the raised receive-confirmation config existed).
    // The empirical settle: the first message sent AFTER that config change, on a
    // sibling corridor with the same asymmetry, sits BLOCKED on LayerZero Scan —
    // months old when checked.
